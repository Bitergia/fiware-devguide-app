## How to build and install

This project integrates a set of Generic Enablers using those enablers inside [docker](https://github.com/docker/docker) containers. It also comes with restaurants, reviews and reservations loaded to start working out of the box, as well as users and organizations to play with it.

For that purpose, [docker](https://github.com/docker/docker) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) are required.
